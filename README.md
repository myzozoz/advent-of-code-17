# Advent Of Code 2017
Solutions to the Advent of Code 2017 challenges.

So far all challenges solved with C++. This might change in the future.

My puzzle inputs are either in text files inside the respective folders or in some cases hard coded into the program (mainly if the input is a single number)

### Challenges:
- [1](adv_1_captcha)
- [2](adv_2_checksum)
- [3](adv_3_memory)
- [4](adv_4_passphrase)
- [5](adv_5_jumps)
- [6](adv_6_banks)
- [7](adv_7_recursive-circus)
